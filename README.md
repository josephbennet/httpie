# **Project Title: Rust CLI Tool**

## **Description**

This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool implemented in Rust. It is designed to assist users in handling various tasks. The tool is inspired by HTTPie, a command-line HTTP client developed in Python. HTTPie is similar to cURL but more user-friendly, providing easier diagnosis of HTTP services.

This Rust CLI tool project is a practice demo from Professor Chen Tian's "First Rust Lesson." The initial project was designed as a straightforward exercise, but I am planning to extend it to achieve a more profound understanding and application of Rust.

## **Features**

- As an expansion of the course, I plan to add more HTTP methods beyond the GET and POST originally implemented.
- I intend to optimize the output display with improvements like syntax highlighting.
- Future considerations include re-architecting the file structure for better error display and enhanced extensibility.
